# Image-Classification-Comparison
A Comparison of Different ML Models for Image Classification


This was my my final project for the course "Data Mining"

It is a Python notebook showcasing the whole process from importing the data to analyzing the final results.

For the dataset I used CIFAR-10

For the ML models, I used Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest Classification.
